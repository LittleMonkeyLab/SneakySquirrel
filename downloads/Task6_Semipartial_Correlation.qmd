## Task 6: Semipartial (Part) Correlation

> This task explores how to isolate the unique contribution of one predictor (e.g., trait anxiety) to a dependent variable (reaction time), controlling for other variables only in the predictor.

### Objective
- Calculate a semipartial correlation between `Fearful_face_RT` and `traitanx`, controlling for `ACS` and `Age` **only in the predictor**.

```{r}
#| label: semipartial-correlation
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Load tidyverse if not already
library(tidyverse)

# Ensure your data is clean
semipartial_data <- fearful_data %>%
  select(Fearful_face_RT, traitanx, ACS, Age) %>%
  drop_na()

# Step 1: Residualize the predictor (traitanx ~ ACS + Age)
resid_traitanx <- lm(traitanx ~ ACS + Age, data = semipartial_data)$residuals

# Step 2: Compute correlation between raw DV and residualized predictor
semipartial_corr <- cor(semipartial_data$Fearful_face_RT, resid_traitanx)
semipartial_corr
```

::: {.callout-tip}
**Interpretation:** This semipartial correlation represents the unique association between trait anxiety and fearful face reaction time, controlling for ACS and Age **only in trait anxiety**. Unlike partial correlation, it leaves the DV unadjusted.
